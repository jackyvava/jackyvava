## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jacky**, a prospective PhD student with a passion for **vortex dynamics**, **AI4Science**, and **computer graphics**. My research focuses on exploring how **artificial intelligence** can drive innovation in scientific discovery, particularly in fields related to fluid dynamics and computational methods.

I'm deeply interested in the transformative power of AI and its potential to **change the world for the better**. Alongside my scientific pursuits, I enjoy immersing myself in **philosophy** and **history**, which helps broaden my perspective both in life and in research.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about science, AI, or just share some good book recommendations!
